## Roll call 
  
## Antitrust Policy
Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct 
all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. 
It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities 
that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are 
described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy. 
If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, 
feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.

### 1. White Paper Discussion - [State Of Green Software Innovation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aqb-pm-mFKdm4DzAZv3LNoDIsZW9cCZhUYxOWjJV7rY/edit)


First contribution could be create State of Green Software Innovation.
This living document, “The State of Green Software Innovation”, describes the current state of innovation in the green software space. 

This document will:
- List and categorise all of the current research in the space of Green software. (A space could be create a sublist. eg. AI, Blockchain,... )
- List and categorise all of the open data repositories in the space of Green software.
- List and categorise all of the open source repositories in the space of Green software.

The document is living and so will continue to be kept up to date with the latest innovation in the green space so it will also have guidelines for contributions.
The document will surface opportunities for the Innovation working group. Identify the current gaps and inform the working group where to make future investments to close those gaps.

### Document scheduling:
- The first version will be created by the Innovation working group in the private GitHub : iwg_paper_green_software_innovation
  - Each list or sublist must have a owner come from the Innovation Working Group members
- A public version will be available at the end of July in the foundation's public Github repository.
- The Innovation working group validates the pull request to accept the items in the lists.
