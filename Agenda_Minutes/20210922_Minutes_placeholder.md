## Review - [Awesome Green Software](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/awesome-green-software)

Dan begins the discussion by outlining for the new members

> WG Agree to the PR and Merged


Further to this topic Daniel indicated if there was a vetting process to in place for all referenced material. Asim outlined that at the top of the Awesome-Green-Software there will have a disclaimer to outline that any research papers outlined in this list isn't endourced by the GSF.
Abhishek suggested most awesome lists follow the model of inviting very broad contributions and the disclaimer can help alleviate concerns? and Taylor Potential solution is to start the quality control process @Daniel is speaking of and begin endorsing papers over time.  Then have the current list be a 'under review, not currently endorsed' 

The WG agreed there should be a curated list that has been validated/vetted by the GSF WG
