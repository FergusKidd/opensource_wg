## Project Proposals

### Time For The Planet
>Support companies - TimeForThePlanet, MSFT

Ivan from TimeForThePlanet will present a [project to create marketplace solution to certify the Carbon Dividend](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wOwTCdDsDtAHEdqUgB7Ab3hNJjrvtdYE4VlgvoP1D9E/edit?usp=sharing)
- Pierre starts the discussion by reviewing the proposed project submission - Scope - To achieve this goal, it is necessary to provide a technology platform based on trust and certification to demonstrate effectiveness.

- Ivan - Continues the presentation by reviewing TimeForThe Planet presentation video link :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PlRHj8jPt4 
https://www.time-planet.com/en

Ivan highlighted - Platform will need to interconnect with WG Standard from GSF and comply with all worldwide best practices methodologies (GHGP from RSI.org…) in order to provide full trust to all future parties using this standard claim platform. Computation code will be released as MIT opensource on GIT Hub repositrory. Connectors will be provided to access Carbon time registrar with API to write read counters (Climates dividends, AEC,CC certificates …)

H.Parker - Why is blockchain the right tool for this? Tracking “input” and “investors” could be tracked using other methods correct? Second question, what does this add to our ability to track or eliminate carbon? This focuses only on tracking already measured carbon footprint correct?
Ivan - Why is blockchain the right tool for this? Tracking “input” and “investors” could be tracked using other methods correct? Second question, what does this add to our ability to track or eliminate carbon? This focuses only on tracking already measured carbon footprint correct?
For your second question it is a track scope 3

Action Item - Members to submit comments against the project proposal

### Software Carbon Intensity - Open Data Project

[Software Carbon Intensity - Open Data Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n9VLDY689Y62SnwoZ2rCLVMMAkeA5tAQBG31dYv0Sxk/edit#) - Dan Lewis-Toakley

Dan starts the discussion by reviewing the project proposal - open Data Project. 
Once we publish the Software Carbon Intensity Standard, we are going to want software technologists to be able to easily use the standard to measure the SCI of their application. In order to use the standard, technologists will need a number of different input data sources that the standard itself won’t necessarily provide.

Dan made a request to the WG for volunteer member participants to join the project.

> Action Item - Members to submit comments against the project proposa. Comments to be reviewed at the next meeting
