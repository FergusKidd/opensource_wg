## Review Proposed Innovation Deliverables (Discussion)

### 0. Validate the Innovation Working Group scope
Pierre Lagarde leads a discussion to define the Innovation WG Scope 
Asim leasd the discussion to review the proposed Scope of WG -[Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aqb-pm-mFKdm4DzAZv3LNoDIsZW9cCZhUYxOWjJV7rY/edit)
'Proposed Scope' *The scope of the innovation working group is to direct open-source, open-data and academic research in areas that advance the field of green software. 
Sponsor key open-source and open-data projects to give confidence they will be supported and maintained for the long term.*

The WG discussed a proposal to create an, “Awesome List of Green Software Innovation”, that describes the current state of innovation in the green software space.
Rather than 'Awesome' Abhishek proposed for the doc to be renamed 'Pulse of Green Software Innovation'. Neville added any research project must begin with a study phase
in which all the researchers analyze what the situation of the research topic is before they intend to obtain results in the project. This initial phase is traditinally referred to as the 'State of the art study'.
Give this, Neville proposed to call the doc - State of Art for Green Software. The WG agreed to maintain the proposed doc title as “Awesome List of Green Software Innovation”

WG discussed how the 'Awesome list' should be presented to the wider public - example https://github.com/topics/awesome & https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme
Bill/Abhishek highlighted the list can become a source that feeds into creating the SOTA report

Abhishek added that the WG can seed the list but. the real value will come 'Socializing' it so that the WG can source inputs from the wider community via PR's.

WG agree to create an Awesom List - an proposed example to follow - https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python
