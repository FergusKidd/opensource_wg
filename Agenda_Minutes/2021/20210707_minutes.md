- Each participating member offered a brief introduction

## Define a high-level Working Group Scope (Discussion)
Pierre Lagarde 

Pierre begins the discussion by reviewing a draft WG document that will be used as a starting point for defining the WG. (Draft available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RMIsw2naKvW8Vbpc91kghr-mG39_9c5f/edit)). This discussion highlighted several recommendations for OKRs for proposed WG’s – Green Applications – Carbon Aware - Carbon Efficient – Hardware Efficient. 
Pierre proposed 3 innovations for the WG to focus on over the coming year.

1.	A SDK for developers on 3 platforms to measure the carbon impact of his application
2.	An End 2 End prototype for video streaming solution (client and server)
3.	Create a green blockchain with Hyperleger to validate carbon save for applications

This topic prompted a broader discussion with a recommendation from Asim for the WG to create a White paper stating what’s important and why - Areas to consider - streaming, machine learning, block-chain, tooling. Abhishek added that the WG should create a taxonomy for this domain. Neville indicated two broader questions that the WG should look into - What is green software engineering (is there a definition for this) and how does a customer know how green they are? Neville highlighted an area that the WG should examine is delivering a Carbon Intensity tooling calculator. 

Asim suggested to identify - What is the current state of play in Green Software? What are the opportunities for innovation?

Pierre requested for all WG members to collaborate/edit this document, with a view of finalising it by the end of July.

For the next meeting Pierre requested for the WG members to review/validate the proposed 3 innovations and identify which one the WG should start with.
