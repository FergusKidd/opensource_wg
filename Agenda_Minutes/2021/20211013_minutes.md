## Antitrust Policy
Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct 
all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. 
It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities 
that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are 
described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy. 
If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, 
feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.

b. Add 3 Linux Tools - https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/awesome-green-software/pull/32
Kariya - As the name suggests, ipmitool and FreeIPMI are tools for IPMI, but we can also get the power consumption of a bare metal machine through DCMI
(IPMI extension). PowerTOP is mainly for laptops, but it cat estimate the power consumption of each process based on the battery discharge information obtained by ACPI and Linux perf events etc.
I think these tools are useful, but please reject this PR if they don't fit the purpose of this list.

b. Ethos of this list to be articulated - https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/awesome-green-software/issues/14
Asim: is there already a process in academia to raise papers that are supported?
Daniel S: within some communities there is certain canonical papers, but there is no general solution... Hope that we can do this in our Green Software community though. There are some journals related to green software and sustainability that we could look to, e.g. Sustainable Software Systems, Environmental Modeling and Software.
